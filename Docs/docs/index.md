# KanBan Board Project

## Description

Kanban board. Was thinking something SQL for the backend and either React or Angular for frontend. The data is per project, where projects are comprised of tasks. Tasks have a date, state (only ever backlog, ready to work, in progress, blocked, in review, or done) (at first). I want a frontend that lists current projects, after selection a board with swimlanes appears with a backlog under it. Tasks in backlog status are under the board. Every other status task is in the board. Each task is a card and can be moved to any other lane or area anytime, with it's status updated.
